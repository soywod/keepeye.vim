CONFIGURATION                                            *keepeye-configuration*

Here the default configuration:

To automatically launch KeepEye at vim startup
>
  let g:keepeye_autostart = v:true
<
To customize the KeepEye callback:
>
  let g:keepeye_callback = 'keepeye#Callback'
<
To customize the KeepEye message (only if `g:keepeye_callback` is not set ):
>
  let g:keepeye_message = 'SAVE YOUR EYES, TAKE A BREAK'
<
To play a bell sound (default player is [mpv](https://mpv.io/). It will play only if `g:keepeye_callback` is not set)
>
  let g:keepeye_system_bell = v:false

To set a custom player to play the bell sound

  let g:keepeye_system_bell_cmd = 'cvlc' " It will use mplayer to play the bell

In case you need to add some specific behavior to your custom player

  let g:keepeye_system_bell_cmd_flags = 'flags'

To show the KeepEye message in the notification system (only Linux systems are supported):
>
  let g:keepeye_system_notification = v:false
<
To change the timer (in seconds):
>
  let g:keepeye_timer = 1500 " (25min, like the Pomodoro Technique)
<
To use specific statusline highlight group (`see :help hl-User`):
>
  let g:keepeye_statusline_hl_group = v:null

  " For example, to use red background with white text, add this to vimrc:
  higlight User1 guifg=#ffffff guifb=#ff0000
  let g:keepeye_statusline_hl_group = 1
