# KeepEye

KeepEye is a vim plugin that invites you to take a break after a huge coding session. By default, it will notify you after 25min, with the message at the middle of your status line: `SAVE YOUR EYES, TAKE A BREAK`.

let g:keepeye_message = 'SAVE YOUR EYES, TAKE A BREAK' " set the message to show
let g:keepeye_system_bell = v:false                    " enable the bell sound (1)
let g:keepeye_system_bell_cmd = 'vclc'                 " set a custom player to ring the bell

let g:keepeye_timer = 1500                             " set the work time, 25min by default

To color your statusline in red via the hl group `User1`:

```

To use moc player to ring the bell
```viml
let g:keepeye_system_bell = v:true
let g:keepeye_system_bell_cmd = "mocp"
let g:keepeye_system_bell_cmd_flags = '-l'
```
