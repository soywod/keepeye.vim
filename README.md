## Introduction

KeepEye is a vim plugin that invites you to take a break after a huge coding session.

By default, it will notify you after 1h, with the message at the middle of your status line: `SAVE YOUR EYES, TAKE A BREAK`.

## Installation

```viml
Plug 'soywod/vim-keepeye'
```

## Usage

`:KeepEye` to start the timer

`:KeepEyeClear` to clear the message and reset the status bar

## Configuration

To automatically launch KeepEye at vim startup:

```viml
let g:keepeye_autostart = 0 | 1
```

Default value: `0`

To customize the KeepEye callback:

```viml
let g:keepeye_callback = 'MyCallback'
```

Default value: `'keepeye#Callback'`

To customize the KeepEye message (only if `g:keepeye_callback` is not set ):

```viml
let g:keepeye_message = '-- CUSTOM MESSAGE --'
```

Default value: `'SAVE YOUR EYES, TAKE A BREAK'`

To show the KeepEye message in the notification system (only Linux systems are supported):

```viml
  let g:keepeye_system_notification = 0 | 1
```

Default value: `0`

To change the timer (in seconds):

```viml
let g:keepeye_timer = 10
```

Default value: `3600`
